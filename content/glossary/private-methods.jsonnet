  term: 'Private methods',
  meaning: |||
    Methods that contain sensitive information and restricted to approved researchers only. These methods also include author-restricted methods. Access to individual private methods requires permission as there are certain requirements that need to be met before access is granted. Click on the private method you need to access.  You will be provided with an email address and a subject label.  Send an email to the address with the subject label in the subject box.  Detail your name and occupation, what project you require the method for and why you need it for the project.  Being granted permission is then at the discretion of the method owner.
